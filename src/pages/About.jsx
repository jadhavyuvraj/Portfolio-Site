  Hello! I’m <strong>Yuvraj Jadhav</strong>, currently pursuing my 
  <strong>B.Tech in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at VIT Pune</strong>. 
  I have a strong technical foundation in <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, SQL, 
  Data Structures & Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming</strong>. 
  Along with this, I am deeply interested in <strong>Data Analytics</strong> 
  and continuously upskill myself through hands-on learning.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)" }}>
  I have completed recognized certifications, including 
  <strong>Google Data Analytics (Coursera)</strong> and 
  <strong>Programming Foundations in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> from Duke University. 
  Throughout my academic journey, I have built impactful projects such as a 
  <strong>Blockchain-Enabled Voting System</strong>, a 
  <strong>Deepfake Detection System</strong> using deep learning, and an 
  <strong>Instagram-Style Chitchat Application</strong> developed in Java. 
  These projects strengthened my problem-solving abilities and expanded my practical understanding 
  of real-world systems.
</p>

<p style={{ fontSize: "1.1rem", color: "rgba(255,255,255,0.8)" }}>
  I have also been fortunate to achieve several milestones — 
  <strong>Winner of the I2I COEP Hackathon 2025</strong>, 
  <strong>1st Runner-Up at the Innovation Expo 2025</strong>, and a 
  <strong>research publication in an IEEE Conference (2024)</strong>. 
  I have additionally <strong>filed a patent</strong> for one of my innovative projects. 
  With strong analytical thinking, adaptability, and a passion for building meaningful technology, 
  I aim to contribute to impactful solutions and continue growing as an engineer.
</p>
